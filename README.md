# Biodiveristy-stability relationships across taxa

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Here you find the code and data necessary to reproduce the analysis in
the manuscript: **Cross-taxa analysis of long-term data reveals a
positive biodiversity-stability relationship with taxon-specific
mechanistic underpinning**

### Main folders

In `data` you find all the data necessary to run the analysis and
compute the diversity and stability metrics.  
In `function` you find the functions created optmize the analysis
workflow.  
In `script` you find the code for the analysis and figures.  
In `output` you find the output from models, figures and table.

### R project

We used the [{renv} package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html)
to a create reproducible environments for the analysis.

By downloading the full repository, you are able to use the `.Rproj`
file to have the same environment as used in the analysis.

**R version 4.2.2**
